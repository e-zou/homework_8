                                The WiCS club at the University of Virginia holds an annual hackathon each year. It’s a new tradition that was started a couple of years ago, and there’s still a lot to put together. Without any documentation and barely any money from previous years, the co-directors were tasked to recruit and train a new team, raise funds, and establish procedures and templates for the coming years.

                            The main goal of the Women in Computer Science Club is to continue the recruitment of women in the STEM field. Because our hackathon team is a division of this club, anything that we design have to put women and minorities at the forefront.

                    <p>
                        Both of us co-directors have no experience in leading a hackathon, so we must do careful research and recruit the right kinds of people to do the jobs that we need to get done. In addition, we must make sure team understands the smaller picture of a hackathon, but also the bigger picture of funneling women into STEM.

                    <p>
                        Without money, it would not be possible to host a traditional hackathon. We have to consider costly items such as free food, shirts, and stickers for hundreds of people and marketing materials.

                            <p>
                                While most clubs at UVA have complicated applications in which students compete with past history, we opted out of that process. We did this because that would discourage people with no experience from applying, which tends to be women and people of color. We didn’t want to perpetuate a system of inequality when selecting our team.

                            </h1>
                            <p>
                                One downside of letting anyone apply is that a lot of people are inexperienced and will need guidance. In order to combat this, Gabby and I custom created many templates, guides, and resources for new members to learn from.

                            <p>
                                There’s a very short time for getting funding, so we focused on UVA alumni. We also developed plans to divide and conquer so that every day, someone was emailing a recruiter. Some emails were definitely cold emails, but surprisingly, some people responded. In addition, I wrote two unique and different templates that anyone could use.

                            <p>
                                UVA has another hackathon group that we must account for. After all, we share the hackathon space and companies with them. We wanted to adopt a collaborative approach when marketing and fundraising. We didn’t want a situation where we stifle each other for funds and resources because companies did not understand that we were a different group. Hence, we set up liasons for both clubs and cross-promoted materials for each club.
