                            The Kelly Strayhorn Theater is a local Pittsburgh theater that hosts and produces a variety of contemporary and experimental shows. In the midst of a pandemic, the theater team seeks ways to improve user engagement, community participation, donations. Our team was tasked to understand the theater problem space and then make proposals for changes.

                            The Kelly Strayhorn Theater has a rich history of promoting and engaging with diversity in the East Liberty Community. Our team have to be careful in the types of participants that we recruit, making sure to account for a wide array of people. In addition, the coronavirus pandemic has made it crucial to not only understand how traditional theaters work but also the caveats of a virtual experience, so that we can integrate the best of both.

                        After conducting some preliminary findings and looking at competitor websites, we narrowed down the scope of our project so that we find ways to increase participation. In order to keep the theater thriving, we must find a way for the theater to work with the established community but also to expand to working with new members.
